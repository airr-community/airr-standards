AIRR Community Data Standards
=============================

Introduction
============

One of the core initiatives of the Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire
(AIRR) Community [Breden_2017]_ has been to develop standards regarding
the content and format of metadata associated with AIRR sequencing
datasets. The primary aim of this effort is to make published AIRR
datasets `FAIR`_ (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). This
work has been a joint effort between the AIRR Community's `Minimal
Standards`_ and `Database Representation`_ Working Groups. 

.. _`FAIR`: https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples
.. _`Minimal Standards`: http://airr.irmacs.sfu.ca/working_groups/minimal_standards
.. _`Database Representation`: http://airr.irmacs.sfu.ca/node/36


The MiAIRR Data Standard
========================

In order to support FAIR-ness, reproducibility, quality control, and
data deposition in a common repository, the AIRR Community has agreed to
six high-level data sets that will guide the publication, curation and
sharing of AIRR-seq data and metadata:

-  study and subject

-  sample collection

-  sample processing and sequencing

-  raw sequence reads

-  processing of sequence data

-  processed AIRR sequences

These data sets and their associated individual items are referred to as
**MiAIRR**, the Minimum information about an Adaptive Immune Receptor
Repertoire sequencing experiment. The MiAIRR data standard has recently
been published together with a first implementation using the NCBI
repository structure [Rubelt_2017]_. For further information, including
a submission guide and a detailed specification, see `here`__.
