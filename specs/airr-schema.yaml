# MiAIRR specification extensions

# The OpenAPI specification for MiAIRR fields within the schema
# definitions for AIRR standards objects is extended to provide a
# number of MiAIRR specific attributes. This schema definition
# specifies the structure, property names and data types. These
# attributes are attached to a MiAIRR field with x-miairr property.

                Identifier for the Rearrangement object. May be identical to sequence_id,
                but will usually be a univerally unique record locator for database applications.
        repertoire_id:
            type: string
            description: Identifier to the associated repertoire in study metadata.
        data_processing_id:
            type: string

                Identifier to the data processing object in the repertoire metadata
                for this rearrangement. If this field is empty than the primary data processing object is assumed.
