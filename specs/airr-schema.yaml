# AIRR specification extensions

# provide a number of AIRR specific attributes. This schema definition
# specifies the structure, property names and data types. These
# attributes are attached to an AIRR field with the x-airr property.

                In case an experimental setup is used that physically links nucleic acids derived from distinct
                `Rearrangements` before library preparation, this field describes the mode of that linkage. All
                `hetero_*` terms indicate that in case of paired-read sequencing, the two reads should be expected
                to map to distinct IG/TR loci. `*_head-head` refers to techniques that link the 5' ends of transcripts
                in a single-cell context. `*_tail-head` refers to techniques that link the 3' end of one transcript to
                the 5' end of another one in a single-cell context. This term does not provide any information whether
                a continuous reading-frame between the two is generated. `*_prelinked` refers to constructs in which
                the linkage was already present on the DNA level (e.g. scFv).
