# AIRR Data File
#
# A JSON data file that holds Repertoire metadata, data processing
# analysis objects, or any object in the AIRR Data Model.
#
# It is presumed that the objects gathered together in an AIRR Data File are related
# or relevant to each other, e.g. part of the same study; thus, the ID fields can be
# internally resolved unless the ID contains an external PID. This implies that AIRR
# Data Files cannot be merged simply by concatenating arrays; any merge program
# would need to manage duplicate or conflicting ID values.

# While the properties in an AIRR Data File are not required, if one is provided then
# the value should not be null.

                leader sequence) and 2) include the last complete codon of the J gene (i.e. 1 bp 5' of the J->C
                splice site) and 3) provide sequence information for all positions between 1) and 2). To be considered

                categories of sequences in the given experiment. It SHOULD NOT be used as a replacement of a NULL value.

                In case an experimental setup is used that physically links nucleic acids derived from distinct

                `hetero_*` terms indicate that in case of paired-read sequencing, the two reads should be expected
                to map to distinct IG/TR loci. `*_head-head` refers to techniques that link the 5' ends of transcripts
                in a single-cell context. `*_tail-head` refers to techniques that link the 3' end of one transcript to
                the 5' end of another one in a single-cell context. This term does not provide any information whether
                a continuous reading-frame between the two is generated. `*_prelinked` refers to constructs in which
                the linkage was already present on the DNA level (e.g. scFv).
