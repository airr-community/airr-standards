**Version 1.3 schema release.**

New Schema:

1. Introduced the ``Repertoire`` Schema for describing study meta data.
2. Introduced the PCRTarget Schema for describing primer target locations.
3. Introduced the SampleProcessing Schema for describing experimental processing
   steps for a sample.
4. Replaced the SoftwareProcessing schema with the DataProcessing schema.

   and cells as Clone, Tree, Node, and Cell objects, respectively.

General Updates:

   extension attributes in the ``x-airr`` field. The new ``Attributes`` object
   contains definitions for these ``x-airr`` field attributes.

   API major version 1.

Ontology Support:

1. Added ``Ontology`` and ``CURIEResolution`` objects to support ontologies.
2. Added vocabularies/ontologies as JSON string for: Cell subset, Target substrate, Library generation method,
   Complete sequences, Physical linkage of different loci.
