Getting Started
=======================

This website provides information and resources regarding
the AIRR Community Standards for the diverse community of immunology
researchers, bioinformaticians, and software developers.

MiAIRR standard for study data submission and query
---------------------------------------------------

+ Gather experimental and analysis information about your study to conform to the :ref:`MiAIRR <MiAIRR>` standard (minimal information about adaptive immune receptor repertoires).

+ :ref:`Submission <Data_Submission>` of your study data to a public repository.

+ :ref:`Query <Data_Submission>` publicly available AIRR-seq studies.

Resources related to data representations and software development
------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Schema, definitions and file formats for the :ref:`AIRR Data Model <DataRepresentations>`. The AIRR Data Model defines the structure and relationship for the MiAIRR data elements.

+ :ref:`Software guidelines <ToolsStandard>` for tools developers to enable rigorous and reproducible immune repertoire research.

+ :ref:`AIRR Data Commons API <DataCommons>` provides programmatic access to query and download AIRR-seq data.

Software tools and libraries
----------------------------

+ :ref:`Python reference library <PythonOverview>` for reading/writing/validating AIRR data files.

+ :ref:`R reference library <ROverview>` for reading/writing/validating AIRR data files.

+ :ref:`ADC API reference implementation <ADCAPIReference>` for a local data repository.

+ :ref:`Applications <ApplicationSupport>` that support the AIRR Standards.
