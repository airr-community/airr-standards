.. _FormatSpecification:

Format Specification
-----------------------------

Data for ``Rearrangement`` or ``Alignment`` objects are stored as rows in a
*tab-delimited* file and should be compatible with any TSV reader.
A dataset is defined in this context as: a TSV file, a TSV with a companion YAML file
containing metadata, or a directory containing multiple TSV files and YAML files.

**Encoding**

+ The file should be encoded as ASCII or UTF-8.
+ Everything is case-sensitive.

**Dialect**

+ The record separator is a newline ``\n`` and the field separator is a tab ``\t``.
+ Fields or data should not be quoted.
+ A header line with the AIRR-specified column names is always required.
+ Values must not contain tab or newline characters.
+ Values should avoid ``@``, ``#``, and quote (``"`` or ``'``) characters,
  as the result may be implementation dependent.
+ Nested delimiters are not supported by the schema explicitly and should be avoided.
  However, if multiple values must be reported in a single column for an application
  specific reason, then the use of a comma as the delimiter is recommended.

**File names**

AIRR formatted TSV files should end with ``.tsv``.

Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data file has two sections in this order:

1.  Header. A single line with column names.
2.  Data values. One record per line.

A comment section preceding the header (e.g., ``#`` or ``@`` blocks) is not part of the
specification, but such a section is reserved for potential inclusion in a future
release. As such, a comment section should not be included in the file as it *may*
be incompatible with a future specification.

**Header**

A single line containing the column names and specifying the field order.
Any field that corresponds to one of the defined fields should use the
specified field name.

**Required columns**

Some of the fields are defined as ``required`` and therefore must always be present
in the header.  Note, however, that all columns allow for null values.  Therefore,
required columns exist to define a core set of fields that are always present in
the table structure, but do not mandate that a value be reported.

**Custom columns**

There are no restrictions on inclusion of additional custom columns in the
Rearrangements file, provided such columns do not use the same name as an
existing required or optional field. It is recommended that custom fields
follow the same naming scheme as existing fields. Meaning, ``snake_case``
with narrowing scope when read from left to right. For example,
``sequence_id`` is the "*identifier* of the *query sequence*".

Consider submitting a pull request for a field name reservation to the
`airr-standards repository <https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards>`_
if the field may be broadly useful.

**Ordering**

There are no requirements that fields or records be sorted or
ordered in any specific way. However, the field ordering provided by the
schema is a recommended default, with top-to-bottom equating to left-to-right.

Data Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The possible data types are ``string``, ``boolean``, ``number`` (floating point),
``integer``, and ``null`` (empty string).

**Boolean values**

Boolean values must be encoded as ``T`` for true and ``F`` for false.

**Null values**

All fields may contain null values. This includes columns that are described as
``required``. A null value should be encoded as an empty string.

**Coordinate numbering**

All alignment sequence coordinates use the same scheme as IMGT and INSDC
(DDBJ, ENA, GenBank), with the exception that partial coordinate information
should not be used in favor of simply assigning the start/end of the alignment.
Meaning, coordinates should be provided as 1-based values with closed intervals,
without the use of ``>`` or ``<`` annotations that denoted a partial region.

**CIGAR specification**

Alignments details are specified using the CIGAR format as defined in the
`SAM specifications <https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf>`__, with
some vocabulary restrictions on the use of clipping, skipping and padding operators.
The following table defines the valid operator set.

.. csv-table::
    :header: Operator, Description
    :widths: auto

    "=", "An identical non-gap character."
    "X", "A differing non-gap character."
    "M", "A positional match in the alignment. This can be either an identical (=) or differing (x) non-gap character."
    "D", "Deletion in the query (gap in the query)."
    "I", "Insertion in the query (gap in the reference)."
    "S", "Positions that appear in the query, but not the reference. Used exclusively to denote the start position of the alignment in the query. Should precede any N operators."
    "N", "A space in the alignment. Used exclusively to denote the start position of the alignment in the reference. Should follow any S operators."

Note, the use of either the ``=``/``X`` or ``M`` syntax is valid, but should be used consistently.
While leading ``S`` and ``N`` operators are required, tailing ``S`` and ``N`` operators are optional.
