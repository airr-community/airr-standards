Alignment Schema (Experimental)
===============================

An Alignment is the output from a V(D)J assignment process for a
single V, D, J, or C gene segment for a sequence. It is not necessary
that the V(D)J assignment process performs a sequence alignment
algorithm, as the schema can support any algorithmic process. Multiple
Alignment records are supported and expected for a single sequence
with context-dependent fields (``score``, ``identity``, ``support``,
``rank``) for assessing the quality of assignments that can vary
considerably in definition based on the methodology used.

Note, this schema definition is still experimental and should not be
considered final.
