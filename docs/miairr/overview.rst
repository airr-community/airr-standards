*Minimum information about an Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire
Sequencing Experiment*

--------------

Introduction
============

One of the primary initiatives of the Adaptive Immune Receptor
Repertoire (AIRR) Community has been to develop a set of metadata
standards for the submission of AIRR sequencing datasets. This work has
been carried out by the `AIRR Community Minimal Standards Working
Group <http://airr.irmacs.sfu.ca/working_groups/minimal_standards>`__.
In order to support reproducibility, standard quality control, and data
deposition in a common repository, the AIRR Community has agreed to six
high-level data sets that will guide the publication, curation and
sharing of AIRR-Seq data and metadata: Study and subject, sample
collection, sample processing and sequencing, raw sequences, processing
of sequence data, and processed AIRR sequences. The detailed data
elements within these sets are defined
`here <https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/blob/master/AIRR_Minimal_Standard_Data_Elements.tsv>`__.

Implementations
===============

-  `NCBI-based <https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/tree/master/NCBI_implementation>`__
-  AIRR Common Repositories - *in development*
