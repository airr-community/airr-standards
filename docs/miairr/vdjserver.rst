Introduction to VDJServer
=========================

VDJServer is a cloud-based analysis portal for immune repertoire sequence data that
provides access to a suite of tools for a complete analysis workflow, including modules
for preprocessing and quality control of sequence reads, V(D)J gene assignment,
repertoire characterization, and repertoire comparison. VDJServer also provides
sophisticated visualizations for exploratory analysis. It is accessible through a standard
web browser via a graphical user interface designed for use by immunologists, clinicians,
and bioinformatics researchers. VDJServer provides a data commons for public sharing of
repertoire sequencing data, as well as private sharing of data between users.
