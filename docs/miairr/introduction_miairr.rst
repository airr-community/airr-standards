Introduction to MiAIRR
======================

Summary
=======

An early objective of the Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) Community
was the development of metadata standards for AIRR sequencing dataset
submissions. This effort was led by the `AIRR Community Minimal Standards
Working Group`_, which disbanded upon completion of its task. To enhance
reproducibility, standardize quality control, and facilitate data deposition in
a shared repository, the AIRR Community has adopted six high-level data sets as
published in 2017 [Rubelt_2017]_. These data sets guide the publication,
curation, and sharing of AIRR-Seq data and metadata: Study and subject, sample
collection, sample processing and sequencing, raw sequences, processing of
sequence data, and processed AIRR sequences. The detailed data elements within
these sets are defined :ref:`here <MiAIRR_Elements>`
(:download:`Download as TSV <../_downloads/AIRR_Minimal_Standard_Data_Elements.tsv>`).
