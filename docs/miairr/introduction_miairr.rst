Introduction to MiAIRR
======================

Summary
=======

One of the primary initiatives of the Adaptive Immune Receptor
Repertoire (AIRR) Community has been to develop a set of metadata
standards for the submission of AIRR sequencing datasets. This work has
been carried out by the `AIRR Community Minimal Standards Working Group`_.
In order to support reproducibility, standard quality control, and data
deposition in a common repository, the AIRR Community has agreed to six
high-level data sets that will guide the publication, curation and
sharing of AIRR-Seq data and metadata: Study and subject, sample
collection, sample processing and sequencing, raw sequences, processing
of sequence data, and processed AIRR sequences. The detailed data
elements within these sets are defined :ref:`here <MiAIRR_Elements>`
(:download:`Download as TSV <../_downloads/AIRR_Minimal_Standard_Data_Elements.tsv>`).
