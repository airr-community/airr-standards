AIRR Standards
==============

The AIRR Community is developing a set of standards for describing, reporting,
storing, and sharing adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) data, such as
sequences of antibodies and T cell receptors (TCRs). Some specific efforts
include:

+ The MiAIRR standard for describing minimal information about AIRR datasets, including
  sample collection and data processing information.
+ Data representations (file format) specifications for storing large amounts of annotated AIRR data.
+ APIs for exposing a common interface to repositories/databases containing AIRR data.
+ A community standard for software tools which will allow conforming tools to gain community recognition.
