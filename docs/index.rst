AIRR Standards
==============

The AIRR Community is developing a set of standards for describing, reporting,
storing, and sharing adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) data, such as
sequences of antibodies and T cell receptors (TCRs). Some specific efforts
include

- MiAIRR for describing minimal information about AIRR datasets, including
  sample collection and data processing information

- File format specifications for storing large amounts of annotated AIRR data

- APIs for exposing a common interface to repositories/databases containing
  AIRR data
