AIRR Standards
==============

The AIRR Community is developing a set of standards for describing, reporting,
storing, and sharing adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) data, such as
sequences of antibodies and T cell receptors (TCRs). Some specific efforts
include

- MiAIRR for describing minimal information about AIRR datasets, including
  sample collection and data processing information.

- Data representation (file format) specifications for storing large amounts of annotated AIRR data.

- APIs for exposing a common interface to repositories/databases containing
  AIRR data.
