#
# This example code shows how repertoires and associated rearrangments
# may be queried from a data repository. The retrieved data is stored
# in files using the AIRR standards python library. A separate script
# reads the data and performs some simple analysis.
#
# Repertoire output file: repertoires.airr.json
# Rearrangement output file: rearrangements.tsv
#
# We could have written the example to perform the data retrieval and
# analysis in a single script, but we wanted to show the data could be
# saved into files for later use.
#
# This script retrieves data for the following study, which is identified
# by NCBI BioProject PRJNA300878. In this example, we are only going to
# query and retrieve the T cell repertoires.
