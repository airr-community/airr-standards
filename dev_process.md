AIRR Standards Development Process
----------------------------------

The airr-standards repository contains numerous sub-projects within it
which are all highly interconnected. Our goal is a simple workflow for
development that also insures stable versioning and releases for AIRR
data and software associated with publications and database
submissions.

### Git Structure

The `master` branch is utilized for all development for the ongoing
major version of the AIRR Standards. The last major release was MiAIRR
v1.0 so all development work on `master` is for v1.X releases. When
multiple major versions of the AIRR Standards are available, then
these instructions will be updated to reflect the development process for
older versions.

* No commits directly to `master` branch.

* Submit all changes as a pull request.

* Pull requests must pass checks before being merged.

* Merges to `master` can only be performed by the core team, which
  currently includes Syed Ahmad Chan Bukhari, Christian Busse, Scott
  Christley, Jason Vander Heiden, and Uri Laserson.

### Versioning and Release Process

Versions and associated releases are driven by the recommendations and
standards produced by the AIRR Community and their associated Working
Groups, with specifications and software tools implementing those
recommendations and standards.
