# AIRR specification extensions
#
# The schema definitions for AIRR standards objects is extended to
# provide a number of AIRR specific attributes. This schema definition
# specifies the structure, property names and data types. These
# attributes are attached to an AIRR field with the x-airr property.

                Binomial designation of the species from which the analyzed cells originate. Typically, this value
                should be identical to `species`, if which case it SHOULD NOT be set explicitly. Howver, there are
                valid experimental setups in which the two might differ, e.g. chimeric animal models. If set, this
                key will overwrite the `species` information for all lower layers of the schema.

                In case an experimental setup is used that physically links nucleic acids derived from distinct

                `hetero_*` terms indicate that in case of paired-read sequencing, the two reads should be expected
                to map to distinct IG/TR loci. `*_head-head` refers to techniques that link the 5' ends of transcripts
                in a single-cell context. `*_tail-head` refers to techniques that link the 3' end of one transcript to
                the 5' end of another one in a single-cell context. This term does not provide any information whether
                a continuous reading-frame between the two is generated. `*_prelinked` refers to constructs in which
                the linkage was already present on the DNA level (e.g. scFv).
