      study_description: The adaptive immune system's capability to protect the body
        requires a highly diverse lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoire. However, the
        influence of individual genetic and epigenetic differences on these repertoires
        is not typically measured. By leveraging the unique characteristics of B, CD4+
        T, and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets isolated from monozygotic twins, we have quantified
        the impact of heritable factors on both the V(D)J recombination process and
        thymic selection in the case of T cell receptors, and show that the repertoires
        of both naive and antigen experienced cells are subject to biases resulting
        from differences in recombination. We show that biases in V(D)J usage, as well
        as biased N/P additions, contribute to significant variation in the CDR3 region.
        Moreover, we show that the relative usage of V and J gene segments is chromosomally
        biased, with approximately 1.5 times as many rearrangements originating from
        a single chromosome. These data refine our understanding of the heritable mechanisms
        affecting the repertoire, and show that biases are evident on a chromosome-wide
        level.
