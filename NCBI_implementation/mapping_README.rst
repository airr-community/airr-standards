Introduction
============

The three ``mapping_MiAIRR_*.tsv`` tables in this directory provide the
mapping scheme between the MiAIRR data elements and their respective
counterparts (hereafter "attributes") of the three NCBI repositories
BioProject, BioSample and SRA.


Table structure
===============

The tables have five columns:

1. The field name of the MiAIRR data element as defined by the AIRR
   Formats WG

2. The attribute designation in the respective NCBI repository

3. The relation between MiAIRR field name and NCBI attribute:

   -  ``IDENTICAL``: The identical keyword exists in MiAIRR and the
      NCBI repository; it defines similar content.

   -  ``MAPPED``: Non-identical keywords are used by MiAIRR and NCBI
      to define similar content; a 1:1 mapping of the keywords is
      required.

   -  ``MAPPED_NODE``: Non-identical keywords are used by MiAIRR and
      NCBI to define similar content. In addition, NCBI splits the
      content into several sub-keys, which requires some string
      manipulation for a 1:n mapping.

   -  ``AIRR_CUSTOM``: The NCBI repositories does *not* specify an
      attribute for this content, so the MiAIRR field name is directly
      used as custom keyword.

   -  ``DATABASE_SPECIFIC``: This is an NCBI specific term that has
      no correlate in MiAIRR. This should only occur for NCBI specific
      references or information only required during submission (e.g.
      file names).

4. Whether an attribute is required by the NCBI repository (Note that 
   *all* data elements are **required** by MiAIRR)

5. Notes on related attributes
